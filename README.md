# PyBer_Analysis
Performing an exploratory analysis for a ride share company.

## Overview of the Analysis
As a Data Analyst at a Python based ride-sharing app company called Pyber, I have been given the assignment of performing an exploratory analysis using large CSV files. To aid this process, several types of visualizations have been created to communicate a compelling story about the data. To create these visualizations the following below was used:
- Python scripts
- Pandas libraries
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib

The visualizations created help explain relationship between the type of city and number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, drivers, and riders by type of city. The end goal is to help Pyber improve accessability for users and determine affordability for underserved neighbourhoods.
